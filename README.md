# Fordgo Bike Trips Data Exploration
## by Oreoluwa Sobiye


## Dataset
 This data contains information about individual rides made in a bike-sharing system covering the greater San Francisco Bay area. The data is made up of 183412 observations and 16 fields consisting of different data types.


## Summary of Findings
In the exploration analysis, it was observerd that there 0.0054 correlation between duration_sec and age, this shows that there is very little to no relationship between the two variables.

Exploring the user type variable, it was observed that most bike trips are taken by suscribers than customers. The male gender are more likely to go on bike trips than other genders, this observation was explored with the user type and it was seen that more Males are suscribers and customers, the least gender being other. The age range of sucribers fall around 25-40 years.

The days of the week was explored to gain insight to what days bike trips are taken most, to my surprise most bike trips are taken on thursdays and fridays. The least number of bike trips occur on saturdays and sundays. 

It was also observed that less than 50% of bike trips were shared. Most bike trips are taken alone.


## Key Insights for Presentation
For the presentation, I focus on just the age , gender and user type to show the distribution of the variables and how each factor affects the number of bike trips.

The presentation will show the distribution of age of bikers in the San Francisco Bay Area. The age distribution of User_type  and the gender count of bikers.
